            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is basically a main storehouse for all project files to be kept in. It is a solution to the problems involved with file sharing because it allows members of a team to check out files, make any changes they need to and then check them back in. It also records any and all changes that are made to files or a set of files overtime so that users can go back and recall any specific versions they need to without a problem. Changes are identified by a number or letter code, such as “revision 1”, “revision 2” and so on. Each change is also saved with a timestamp as well as the name of the person making the changes.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a widely-used distributed version control system used to manage source code for software development. There is a huge emphasis placed on its abilities of speed and efficiency, even when working with large projects. Just some of its benefits include every user having a complete copy of the repository data on their machine, everything being local, processes running faster and the prevention of unintentional overwrite of a shared file. Git does not allow for the loss of information in transit or file corruption because everything is check-summed before it is stored and then referred to by that checksum with a mechanism called SHA-1 hash.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control Systems, or CVCSs, were developed to deal with the issue of people needing to collaborate with developers on other systems. This was the standard for version control for many years because these systems have a single server containing all the files and a central place for all the clients to be able to check the files out of. This allows everyone to know what everyone else on a project is doing as well as have administrators have control over who can do what. The one main disadvantage is the single point of failure that can occur is a server goes down.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A distributed version control system, or DVCS, allows man software developers to work on any given project without requiring a common network to be shared. Git is an example of a DVCS. Instead of clients checking out the latest snapshot of files, the repository is fully mirrored. Thus, if any server dies it is not as big of a deal as it would be with a CVCS. This is because if the systems are collaborating then any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Other difference from CVCSs is being able to set up several types of workflows, like a hierarchical model.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository resides on a local machine of an individual user as opposed to a remote repository which resides on a server that is shared among multiple team members. If you want to create a local repository you can either create a brand new one or clone an existing remote one onto your local machine. The repositories for local and remote are structured the same way to make it easier for scripts to run on either side or to allow them to be synced for offline use. There is nothing that needs to be done on a regular basis for local repositories besides cleaning it out if short on disk space.</p>
